# ChangeTracker - empower your releases

ChangeTracker is web service that enables you to keep track of your releases and changes.  

Due to the continuous movement towards microservices releases are harder to track.  
Often, monoliths gets subdivided into many micro/nano services, each of them are deployed independently with its own versioning.  

Imagine you're a product owner who is responsible for many products.  
In order to communicate the changes to the customer you need to be up-to-date about the releases.  
Maybe you talk to the developer directly or call an api info endpoint to get the latest deployed version.  
After that, you check what's inside this release in your ticket system to be informed about the latest changes.  

This can be quite cumbersome with an increasing number of products.  

A possible solution is to invert the dependencies.  
The management team where the product owner belongs to should not depend on developers,  
both should dependend on a web service.

The development team automatically pushes its changes during deployment with all the information the management team needs.  

## Disclaimer

This is a side-project and should not be used in a prodcutive environment.  

## Environments

### Testing

This environment consists of a database only that is used by integration tests.  

### Staging

Is a replica of the production environment.  
Uses the same Docker registry and App Service Plan as the production system.

### Production

Actual app

[Production](https://app-change-tracker.azurewebsites.net/)

## Architecture

The architecture of the app is mainly influenced by:

* Robert C. Martin's book Clean Architecture
* Plainionist's article series [Implementing-Clean-Architecture](http://www.plainionist.net/Implementing-Clean-Architecture-Overview/)
* [CandiedOrange's](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/131624/candied-orange) [answers](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/search?q=user:131624+[clean-architecture]) on softwareengineering.stackexchange

## Database

I decided to use a sql database rather than a nosql db,  
because relational databases are a mature technology that fullfils all my requirements.

## Key Features

* Multi-tenant capabilities
* Role-based access control
